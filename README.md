# TextExchange
Simple website for students to exchange textbook

__________
Github 101

-this is the "repository" where we are going to upload all our files

-you can edit any file by clicking the file and then clicking the edit button on the top corner

-after you edit the codes, make sure you document and add comments (or questions but we can do this via Slack)

-you can also create a branch( basically a copy of this repository so you can edit/add codes on your own without affecting this "master" branch, if you're unclear here's a link that helps https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ )

-creating a branch is kinda a hassle so you can just go ahead and edit the codes/add files on this master branch if you want


__________
there's going to be another text file which will act like our backlog

Example:  

   TO-DO
