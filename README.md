# TextExchange
Simple website for students to exchange textbook

Github 101
-this is the repository where we are going to upload all our files
-you can edit any file or code by clicking the edit button on the top corner
-after you edit the codes, make sure you add comments (or questions but we can do this via Slack)
-you can also create a branch( basically a copy of this repository so you can edit/add codes on your own without affecting this "master" branch, if you're unclear here's a link that helps https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ )
-creating a branch is kinda a hassle so you can just go ahead and edit the codes/add files on this master branch if you want

there's going to be another text file which will act like our backlog
we can list things we have to do 
Example:  
TODO:
-homepage html - DONE 
-homepage css -DONE
-registration form - DONE
-registration css - DOING
etc
